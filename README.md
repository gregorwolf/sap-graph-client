# SAP BTP Integration Suite - Graph

## Setup Graph

- Get a SAP BTP Trial Account
- Activate Integration Suite
- Assign yourself the Role Collection `Integration_Provisioner`
- Navigate to the Integration Suite Tenant
- Add the Capability 'API Management' and tick the checkbox for 'API Business Hub Enterprise' which then allows you to also activate 'Graph'
- Assign yourself the Role Collections `Graph.KeyUser` and `GraphNavigator.Viewer`
- Get your api.sap.com APIKey from https://api.sap.com/settings. Import the `API-Sandbox-S4HANACloud` Destination template into your BTP Subaccount
- Maintain the APIKey in the `API-Sandbox-S4HANACloud` Destination using the additional parameter `URL.headers.apikey`
- Now you can Navigate to Integration Suite -> Design -> Graph
- Create a new Graph from File and use `graph/s4hana.json`
- To consume the Graph create an instance of sap-graph with the api plan in your BTP Subaccount
- Create a service key in that instance
- Maintain the credentials in `test/.env` here is the template:

```
graph_clientid=
graph_clientsecret=""
graph_tokenendpoint=
graph_uri=
graph_name=s4hc
```

Test the Graph with the REST Client Scripts for
